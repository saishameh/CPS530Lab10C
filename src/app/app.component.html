      <h3>Installation</h3>
      <p>To get started with Angular, I installed the Angular CLI globally using the following command:</p>
      <code>npm install -g &#64;angular/cli</code>
      <p>
        During installation, I encountered an issue with an outdated version of Node.js. To resolve this, I upgraded Node.js to a version compatible with Angular CLI.

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>I created this Angular project by running:</p>
      <code>ng new my-web-page</code>
      <p>After creating the project, I updated the following files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>app.component.html</strong>: Added the structure and content for this page.</li>
        <li><strong>styles.css</strong>: Customized the styles to enhance the page's appearance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> The Node.js version installed on my system was outdated and incompatible with the Angular CLI, causing issues during the setup and project creation.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> To resolve this, I upgraded Node.js to the latest stable version. This ensured compatibility with the Angular CLI and allowed the installation to proceed smoothly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Implementing form validation was more challenging than anticipated, especially with Angular's reactive forms, as I was not fully familiar with its syntax and structure.<br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> I researched and watched frew tutorials and was able to apply correct validations and display helpful error messages in real-time.<br>
